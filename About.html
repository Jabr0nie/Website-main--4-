				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<section id="mission">
					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>Our mission is to offer insights into how DApps measure up in terms of decentralization according to our criteria. We strive to be clear and objective in our evaluations, but please keep in mind that these are subjective assessments. We aim to help users and developers understand decentralization better and make informed decisions, but our views are just one interpretation of the many factors involved.</p>

					<h2>Why Decentralization Matters</h2>
					<p>Decentralization is a core principle that distinguishes blockchain and decentralized technologies from traditional systems. Its importance extends beyond technical specifications, touching upon fundamental aspects of fairness, security, and innovation. Here’s a closer look at why decentralization is so crucial:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Enhanced Security and Resilience:</strong> Decentralization reduces the risk of single points of failure. In a decentralized network, data and decision-making are distributed across multiple nodes or participants. This distribution means that even if one node fails or is compromised, the rest of the network remains operational. By spreading out resources and responsibilities, decentralized systems are inherently more resilient against attacks, system failures, and malicious activities.</li>
						<li><strong>Greater Transparency and Trust:</strong> Decentralized systems often operate on public or permissionless blockchains where transactions and changes are recorded and visible to all participants. This transparency helps to build trust among users because it allows for independent verification of transactions and governance decisions. When everyone can see and audit the data, it reduces the likelihood of fraud and corruption.</li>
						<li><strong>Reduced Censorship and Control:</strong> In centralized systems, a single authority or a small group controls access and operations, which can lead to censorship and manipulation. Decentralization distributes control among a wider range of participants, making it more difficult for any one entity to impose restrictions or alter information. This openness fosters a more democratic and fair environment where decisions reflect the consensus of the community rather than the interests of a centralized authority.</li>
						<li><strong>Increased Innovation and Participation:</strong> Decentralized networks encourage innovation by lowering the barriers to entry for new participants. Open-source projects and decentralized platforms allow anyone to contribute, build, or enhance the system. This inclusivity accelerates technological advancements and ensures that a broader range of ideas and solutions can be explored and implemented.</li>
						<li><strong>Empowerment and Ownership:</strong> Decentralization empowers individuals by giving them control over their own data and assets. Users in decentralized systems often have ownership of their data and the ability to manage their assets without intermediaries. This self-sovereignty contrasts sharply with traditional systems where central authorities often hold and control user data.</li>
						<li><strong>Economic Efficiency and Fairness:</strong> By removing intermediaries, decentralized systems can lower transaction costs and increase efficiency. Traditional systems often involve multiple parties that take a cut of transactions or services, leading to higher costs. Decentralized solutions streamline processes and reduce these costs, potentially making economic systems fairer and more accessible to everyone.</li>
						<li><strong>Resilience Against Regulatory and Geopolitical Risks:</strong> Centralized systems are vulnerable to regulatory and geopolitical pressures that can lead to restrictions or shutdowns. Decentralized systems, by design, are more resistant to such pressures because they operate on a global scale with no single point of control. This makes them more robust in the face of changing regulatory landscapes and political environments.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We emphasize these aspects of decentralization in our evaluations because we believe they are fundamental to the future of technology and governance. Our aim is to highlight DApps that embody these principles, helping you make informed choices about which applications align with these important values.</p>
				</section>


				<section id="what-we-do">
					<h2>What We Do</h2>
					<p>We evaluate DApps according to a set of criteria that we believe are important for assessing decentralization. These criteria include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Governance:</strong> We look at how decision-making is distributed within the DApp. Our evaluation considers whether governance is centralized or shared among a broader community.</li>
						<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> We assess the distribution and redundancy of the DApp’s infrastructure, including network nodes and data storage, to determine its resilience and avoid single points of failure.</li>
						<li><strong>Token Distribution:</strong> We analyze how tokens or assets are distributed within the DApp to gauge whether power and influence are concentrated or more evenly spread.</li>
						<li><strong>Development Transparency:</strong> We review the openness of the DApp’s development process, including community involvement and transparency of code updates.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Our rankings and analyses are generated using a proprietary algorithm based on these factors, but remember, these reflect our own views and criteria for evaluating decentralization. We strive to be objective, but different perspectives and methodologies can lead to varying opinions on decentralization.</p>
